This week, I attended rconf. It was an amazing opportunity to learn about current best practices in the field, new or up-and-coming packages and methods, and meet the leaders in the community. WOW.

I am still processing a number of thoughts. For now, here is a list of packages I learned about that may directly apply to my work:

-   ecommerce

    -   brochures - supports post requests

    -   callr - used in the ecommerce site

-   pollinatr

    -   readxl

    -   haven / foreign (foreign can also write out sas... can it do spss?)

    -   renv

    -   svdialogs (use popups to get path options)

-   dm (cynkra) for database relational mapping / joining

-   [funspotr](https://github.com/brshallo/funspotr-rstudioconf2022) to spot functions that someone uses e.g. a hadley blog

-   [reportfactor](https://epirhandbook.com/en/reports-with-r-markdown.html#options-3-reportfactory-package)y

-   [data validation cookbook](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/validate/vignettes/cookbook.html#1_Introduction_to_validate)

    -   [also](http://data-cleaning.github.io/validate/)

Products to consider making:

-   general CERP

    -   make a CERP manual in quarto and host it somewhere. e.g. twiki

    -   make package including different years of carnegie data so we can call them easily

    -   be clearer about whose packages i depend on and credit them more obviously

        -   have a main list of packages and what they do / why to use them (add to manual)

    -   talk with everyone about general pain points of things they are doign over and over

    -   data cleaning - improve script to use svdialogs!!

    -   WE NEED A DATABASE

        -   yes

    -   investigate how to use cronR and/or posit connect

-   DBS

    -   dashboard for monitoring incoming data: pull institution / id into google drive --\> R script to make dashboard

    -   cron job or something more automatic for on demand

-   CERP REU

    -   dashboard for monitoring incoming data outside of the time I'm generating contact lists

-   BPCnet

    -   dashboard for plan pipeline status

-   [looped rmarkdowns](https://epirhandbook.com/en/iteration-loops-and-lists.html)

Other thoughts / ideas:

-   "the power of yet" e.g. "I haven't learned that." ---\> "I haven't learned that **yet**."

-   openscapes for general team learning

-   being a pollinator

    -   do no harm

    -   make things that just work

    -   promote growth

-   solo contributor

    -   do as much in R as possible

    -   focus on what is realistic, not ideal

    -   sample workflow

        -   00-setup.R

            -   all report decisions e.g. name, location, filters, run date, effective date

        -   01-prep.R

        -   02-analysis.R

        -   03-dashboard.R
