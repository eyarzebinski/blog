I'm doing a new thing! Hello, world!

My organization, [Computing Research Association](https://cra.org/), generously funded my attendance of a 2 day workshop at rconf, where I learned about Quarto, the next generation of RMarkdown. I learned a lot, including how easily Quarto supports blogging! So, welcome to my Quarto blog. I plan to use this blog mostly as notes to myself as I think through R packages and workflows. Feel free to follow along with me!
